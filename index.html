        <p>
          My name is Dayanara, mostly known by friends &amp; family as <em>Dee</em>. 
          I was born in the USA and raised in Ecuador. I currently live in Florida, 
          where I get to enjoy lovely weather most time of the year with my husband 
          and my precious kids, Joshua and Sophia.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          During my freshman year of high school, I fell in love with programming after 
          taking a course to learn how to "use" a computer.
        </p>
    
        <p>
        With a Bachelors in Computer Information Systems from the Polytechnic School of Ecuador, 
        <abbr title="Escuela Superior Politecnica del Litoral">
          <a href="http://www.espol.edu.ec/" target="_blank">ESPOL</a></abbr>, and years of experience 
          I moved to Florida in 2003 and joined the IS Team at <a href="https://www.iqor.com/" target="_blank"> Iqor </a>Fort Lauderdale, as a Programmer 
          Analyst where I designed and developed several systems like Automated Requisition & Training System, 
          Employee Management Information System, Customer Relationship Management System, to name a few.
        </p>
    
        <p>
        In 2017, I was offered the position of Computer Science Instructor at <a href="" target="_blank">Calvary Christian Academy</a>. 
        This was not an easy decision to make, since I loved my job as a programmer. However, I believe it was a calling, 
        to give back to the new generation and be able to inspire others to pursue this career, giving them the 
        same opportunity I was given in high school.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can truly say I have been <em>blessed</em> with a job I love.
        </p>
