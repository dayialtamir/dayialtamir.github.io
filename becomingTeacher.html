          <h1>Becoming a Teacher</h1>
          <p>
          In 2017, I made the decision to take a break from Software Development and follow the calling to become a <em>high school Computer Science Teacher</em>. 
          Oh boy, it was a difficult decision to make, but I am glad I made it. This has been one of the most rewarding jobs 
          I have ever had. I have met amazing people along the way, and today I have the privilege to be part of an
          amazing faculty team at <a href="https://www.ccaeagles.org/" target="_blank">Calvary Christian Academy Fort Lauderdale</a>.
        
          <p>
          Becoming a teacher has changed my life. I have learned to appreciate teachers even more (especially elementary teachers). 
          Teachers not only prepare lesson plans, teach, and grade, but they are also counselors, psychologists, 
          encouragers, and often, they become these kids' second parents.
          </p>
          <p>
          I didn't think that I would be capable of caring for other kids the same way I care for my biological kids, 
          but I do. It is incredible how much you worry about them. I worry when they do not get enough sleep, 
          or if they haven't had breakfast, especially when they will be taking a test, or when they are struggling 
          in school or when their family life is not going so well. However, they not only bring worry and work to 
          your life, they also bring <em>joy</em>. Their success becomes yours. 
          </p>
          <p>
          I still remember my first group of AP students. These kids were special. We were on this new adventure together. 
          We worked hard throughout the school year. On the day of the exam, we got together to pray and once the test started 
          I stayed outside waiting for an hour and thirty minutes just to be able to be the first one to hear from them 
          how it went.  Their big smiles made me smile. Two months later we were notified that they all passed. I was so 
          proud of them.
          </p>
          <p>
          Although I truly enjoy being a teacher, on some days I do miss working as a developer. I hope soon I can be able to 
          combine both and even be able to hire my students as programmers.
